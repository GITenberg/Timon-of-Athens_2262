description: Timon of Athens is a bitterly intriguing study of a fabulously rich man
  who wastes his wealth on his friends, and, when he is finally impoverished, learns
  to despise humanity with a hatred that drives him to his grave. The play's plot
  structure is schematically clear, and the poetry of Timon's rage is arresting in
  its savage intensity. Yet readers have often detected loose ends, and the tone of
  writing is uneven.
